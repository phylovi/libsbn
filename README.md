# libsbn

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/matsengrp/libsbn/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/matsengrp/libsbn)
[![Travis CI status](https://travis-ci.org/phylovi/libsbn.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/phylovi/libsbn)

We are building a Python-interface C++ library for phylogenetic variational inference so that you can express interesting parts of your phylogenetic model in Python/TensorFlow/PyTorch/etc and let libsbn handle the tree structure and likelihood computations for you.

This library is in an experimental state.


## Dependencies

* If you are on linux, install gcc >= 7.5, which is standard in Debian Buster and Ubuntu 18.04
* If you are on OS X, use a recent version of Xcode and install command line tools

Then, install **the `hmc-clock` branch** of [BEAGLE](https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib).
This will require a from-source installation, as in their docs, but you have to do a full `git clone` (no `--depth=1`).
The BEAGLE install process is somewhat in flux, so it's best to look at the [conda-beagle Dockerfile](https://github.com/matsengrp/conda-beagle/blob/master/Dockerfile) and follow those steps.

To install additional dependencies, use the associated conda environment file:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate libsbn

If you want to specify your compiler manually, set the `CC` and `CXX` shell variables to your desired compiler command.

The notebooks require R, IRKernel, rpy2 >=3.1.0, and some R packages such as ggplot and cowplot.
Do not install R via conda.
Doing so will install the conda compiler toolchain, this will mess up our compilation.


## Building

For your first build, do

* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* `scons`
* Respond to interactive prompts about where `hmc-clock` BEAGLE is installed
* `conda activate libsbn` &nbsp; **(this is an important step, even though you are already in the libsbn conda environment)**
* `make`

After these steps `make` will build, run tests, and install the Python packages, and this should be the only command you need to run after modifying the code.

Note that `scons` and `make` accept `-j` flags for multi-core builds: e.g. `-j20` will build with 20 jobs.

The build process will modify the conda environment to point `[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to where BEAGLE is installed.
If you get an error about missing BEAGLE, just `conda activate libsbn` again and you should be good.
If you want to modify your desired BEAGLE installation location, do `unset BEAGLE_PREFIX` and start the steps above again starting at `scons`.

* (Optional) If you modify the lexer and parser, call `make bison`. This assumes that you have installed Bison > 3.4 (`conda install -c conda-forge bison`).
* (Optional) If you modify the test preparation scripts, call `make prep`. This assumes that you have installed ete3 (`conda install -c etetoolkit ete3`).

Our documentation consists of:

* [Online documentation](https://phylovi.github.io/libsbn/)
* Derivations in `doc/tex`, which explain what's going on in the code.
